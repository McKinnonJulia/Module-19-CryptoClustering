Answer the following questions:
Question: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?

Answer: 3
Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

Answer: Yes, 4 was the better for the original data.

Visualize and Compare the Results
Answer the following question:
Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

Answer: Reducing the features changed the inertia. So PCA had better results for clusters compared to the scaled data. By using the optimal value of 2 from the PCA, we saw more precise clustering.
